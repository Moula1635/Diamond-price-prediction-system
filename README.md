# Diamond-price-prediction-system
I have built a predictive model using KNN Regression, Linear Regression, and PySpark to estimate diamond prices based on attributes such as carat, cut, clarity, and color. This model provides valuable insights for the diamond industry and consumers, facilitating data-driven pricing decisions.
